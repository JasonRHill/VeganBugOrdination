# VeganBugOrdination
This repository has the final code for VDEQ genus reference sites ordinations.  

R code using VEGAN package creates Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and Multi Response Permutation Procedure (MRPP) at genus level 
reference macroinvertebrate sites. This code is useful in determining natural variability at reference sites to guide model development.
